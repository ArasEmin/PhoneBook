This phone book project was built by creating a console application in a simple way. It saves the records with a filing method with a “.dat” extension and a password in a value called “ENCRYPTION_KEY”. A very simple encryption method is used. This encryption is called XOR encryption. It is an encryption that does not require much effort to decrypt. “The complexity of the 'ARSEEnter' key, which I define as 'ENCRYPTION_KEY', makes it very difficult to open the file. As a result, you can use this project to save your phone books or passwords for backup purposes.
